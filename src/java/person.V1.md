# person
## Create a class called Person
## Owner: Aarti Saravanan


//The data members will be:
// givenName - people may change there name so we ask for the name from when they were first born that is on there birth certificate
// familyName - people may change there name so we ask for the name from when they were first born that is on there birth certificate
// Job - data can change
// Place of Birth (DOB) - can't change, is a set date

//The behaviour:
//person(DOB, Place of Birth) - asking for the data required
//not using person() because its an open constructor which would take no data in

//The methods:
//getName() - gets name 
//getDOB() - gets date of birth 
//setDOB() - sets date of birth (can't change)
//setName() - sets name (can't change)
